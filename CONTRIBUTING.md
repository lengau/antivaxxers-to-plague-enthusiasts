## Things I would like help with

- Optimizing the regexes used for the text replacement
- Helping the extension work with edge cases on popular sites
- Removing references to the 'millennials to snake people' extension from which this was forked from the documentation (except in cases where it's obviously appropriate)


## Things I am aware of

- Text replacement is aggressive and does not discriminate on what domains it runs on
- There is a lack of a glossary, even though terms are well documented in [the source](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people/blob/master/Source/content_script.js)
- I'll sometimes allow new terms, but not on any given schedule or via any published criteria
- There is no indication that the extension is running other than text has been replaced
- There is no count of how many words have been changed, either on a given page or historically
- The hypothesis of linguistic determinism is now generally agreed to be false
- I'm an arrogant, humorless hipster
- Open source is a prison
